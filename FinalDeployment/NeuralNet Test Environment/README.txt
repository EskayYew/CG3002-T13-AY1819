FOR FINAL SUBMISSION: CSV FILES CONTAINING DATA HAVE BEEN OMITTED TO SAVE SPACE

Testing the model

1. Ensure that the following files/folders are in the same folder:
	a. TestNN_Correlation.py
	b. NeuralNet_Correlation_Model_TESTING_ONLY.py
	c. The saved model to test (NeuralNet_Correlation. IT HAS NO FILE EXTENSION)
	d. The saved scaler for the model to test. (NeuralNet_Correlation_Scaler. IT HAS NO FILE EXTENSION)
	e. ExtractFeatures.py
	f. ReadCSVToList.py
	g. SegmentData.py
	h. "Test" folder with all the CSV files in their corresponding sub-folders.

2. Open the TestNN_Correlation.py file. Ensure that the folder paths and labels are correct.
2a. You may change the labels and folder paths accordingly.

Ensure that the label names are identical as listed in the README file in the Deployment folder.

3. Run the TestNN_Correlation.py file. Results such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy will be printed in the shell.
